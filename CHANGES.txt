Shifu Change Log

Changes for Shifu-0.2.5
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/97: Upgrade Guagua to latest version 0.7.0.
        a) New features included in Guagua 0.6.0 to continuous improve performance of Shifu:
            1) 'out-of-core' list to support worker to scale out from memory to disk.
            2) Netty-based coordinators to decrease dependency on zookeeper and improve iteration communication performance.
            3) Embedded zookeeper server supported not only in client as a thread, but also in master node as a process.
        b) One improtant feature included in Guagua 0.7.0 to accelerate training in Shifu:
            1) Partial-compete feature means in each iteration master only wait for partial workers complete and to 
               ignore straggler worker result. 
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/105: SPDT stats performance improvement.
        a) 'binningAlgorithm=SPDTI' (default value) in ModelConfig.json#stats is to improve scalability for big data. 
            This solution is based on SPDT binning algorithm and called SPDT-Improvement(SPDTI).
        b) Using SPDTI, with 20 million of records and 1600 variables, 20 minutes to finish stats. With 100 million of 
            records and 1600 variables, 30 minutes to finish stats.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/59: Shifu eval confusion and performance improvement.
        a) With 20 million of records and 1600 variables, 13 minutes to finish eval step compared with 20 minutes in 
            Shifu 0.2.4.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/64: Set the Hadoop parallel number automatically.
        a) With input data set increase, user no need to set 'hadoopParallelNumber' in shifuconfig.
        b) This value is tuned automatically new Shifu.
    * Binning improvement
        a) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/77: Add missing value count as a bin.
        b) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/79: Add weights to binning.
        c) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/80: Weights binning KS/IV/WoE computing.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/72: Support WoE transformation when doing normalization
    * Training step improvement
        a) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/95: NN doesn't support 0 hidden layer.
        b) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/76: Add convergence parameter to Shifu d-train.
        c) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/84: Add local disk support to scale in-memory data set.
        d) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/60: Continuous model training.
        e) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/85: Add 'epochsPerIteration' parameter in NNWorker.
    * Bug fix:
        a) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/98
        b) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/92
        c) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/70
        d) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/69
        e) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/67

Changes for Shifu-0.2.4
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/20: Work flow change.
        a) Old: new -> init -> stats -> varselect -> normalize -> train -> eval
        b) New: new -> init -> stats -> normalize -> varselect -> train -> eval
        c) If do variable selection again after a model, current work flow no need do normalize step, after variable selection then do training step.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/49: Add distributed sensitivity analysis variable selection.
        a) 'varSelect.wrapperEnabled=true' and 'wrapperBy=SE' in ModelConfig.json#varSelect part to enable sensitivity variable selection.
        b) 'wrapperRatio' in ModelConfig.json#varSelect part is a percent to set how many variables will be removed.
        c) To continue variable selection by sensitivity method, run 'shifu varselect' again. 
        d) With 20 million of records and 1600 variables, 70 minutes (45 minutes for 200 epoch training and 25 minutes for sensitivity variable selection).
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/38: Improve scalability in stats step.
        a) 'binningAlgorithm=SPDT' (default value) in ModelConfig.json#stats is to do variable statistics to improve scalability for big data.
            Using SPDT, with 20 million of records and 1600 variables, 50 minutes to finish variable selection.
        b) 'binningAlgorithm=MunroPat' in ModelConfig.json#stats is another approach to do variable statistics to improve scalability for big data.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/58: Improve scalability in eval step for HDFS mode.
        a) With 20 million of records and 1600 variables, 20 minutes to finish eval step with only 1GB driver memory.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/61: Embeded zookeeper server support.
        a) No need to set zookeeper servers so far since embeded zookeeper server will help on training models.
        b) Big data training, independent zookeeper cluster is strongly recommended.
        c) Upgrade Guagua to 0.5.0 to get support from Guagua for this feature.
    * Add PMML standard model converter.
        a) To convert .nn files into pmml, run "shifu export -t pmml" or just "shifu export" (The pmml is default)
           All generated pmml files will be under <Model-Directory>/pmmls/
    * Bug fix:
        a) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/45
        b) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/51
        c) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/39
