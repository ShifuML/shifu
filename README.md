## Download

Please [download](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki/shifu-0.12.0-hdp-yarn.tar.gz) latest shifu [here](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki/shifu-0.12.0-hdp-yarn.tar.gz).

## Getting Started
After shifu downloading, build your first model with Shifu [tutorial](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki/Tutorial---Build-Your-First-ML-Model). More details about shifu can be found in our [wiki pages](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki).

## What is Shifu?
Shifu is an open-source, end-to-end machine learning and data mining framework built on top of Hadoop. Shifu is designed for data scientists, simplifying the life-cycle of building machine learning models. While originally built for fraud modeling, Shifu is generalized for many other modeling domains.

One of Shifu's pros is an end-to-end modeling pipeline in machine learning. With only configurations settings, a whole machine pipeline can be built and model can be much more easy to develop and push to production. The pipeline defined in Shifu is in below:

Shifu provides a simple command-line interface for each step of the model building process, including

* Statistic calculation & variable selection to determine the most predictive variables in your data
* [Variable normalization](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki/Variable%20Transform%20in%20Shifu)
* [Distributed variable selection based on sensitivity analysis](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki/Variable%20Selection%20in%20Shifu)
* [Distributed neural network model training](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki/Distributed%20Neural%20Network%20Training%20in%20Shifu)
* [Distributed tree ensemble model training](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki/Distributed%20Tree%20Ensemble%20Model%20Training%20in%20Shifu)
* Post training analysis & model evaluation
* [Distributed Tensorflow on Shifu](https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/wiki/Distributed-Tensorflow-Support-On-Shifu)

Shifuâ€™s fast Hadoop-based, distributed neural network / logistic regression / gradient boosted trees training can reduce model training time from days to hours on TB data sets. Shifu integrates with Pig workflows on Hadoop, and Shifu-trained models can be integrated into production code with a simple Java API. Shifu leverages Pig, Akka, Encog and other open source projects.

[Guagua](https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua), an in-memory iterative computing framework on Hadoop YARN is developed as sub-project of Shifu to accelerate training progress.
