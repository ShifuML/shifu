## What is Shifu?
Shifu is an open-source, end-to-end machine learning and data mining framework built on top of Hadoop. Shifu is designed for data scientists, simplifying the life-cycle of building machine learning models. While originally built for fraud modeling, Shifu is generalized for many other modeling domains.

Shifu provides a simple command-line interface for each step of the model building process, including

* Statistic calculation & variable selection to determine the most predictive variables in your data
* Variable normalization
* Distributed variable selection based on sensitivity analysis
* Distributed neural network model training
* Post training analysis & model evaluation

Shifuâ€™s fast Hadoop-based, distributed neural network training can reduce model training time from days to hours on TB data sets. Shifu integrates with Pig workflows on Hadoop, and Shifu-trained models can be integrated into production code with a simple Java API. Shifu leverages Pig, Akka, Encog and other open source projects.
